Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel, Iâ€™m twenty-five years old and Iâ€™m building my career as a software developer at SENAI and Transfero Academy.
It was in 2024 that everything started to make sense to me after attending an admissions course for an American university.
This experience was so significant that it made me remember a childhood passion about solving cryptograms, puzzles and magic cubes.

# My knowledge ðŸ§©
I code in C, Java and Python programming languages and had done some logic games in Java and Python (Battleship, Robot Fight, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock).
In addition, I have a deep curiosity for other fields of knowledge (astronomy, philosophy, neuropsychology) because I believe that every single knowledge connects to each other at some hidden point.

# My interests ðŸ”Ž
I am currently diving into many studies on web3 ecosystems, blockchain networks and their consensus mechanisms: I strongly believe that the world should be more decentralized to ensure more security among people and less control over their decisions.
